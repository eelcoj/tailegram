# Tailegram: Telegram Desktop App with Tailwind CSS

Using the default Tailwind configuration. Always a work in progress.

[See an example](https://eelcoj.github.io/tailegram/)

To get started, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

After that, start up Webpack Development Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Webpack Development Server will watch `/src/stylesheet/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.
